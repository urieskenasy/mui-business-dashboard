# MUI Business Dashboard

## Technologies used: 
Nivo, Material UI, React Date Picker, Redux Toolkit, Redux Toolkit Query, MongoDB, nodeJS, expressJS, ReactJS

This is a mock business dashboard application. I created this application for businesses to track their sales, products, employees, and customers. The app contains charts, tables, and a map to provide a simple way for tracking business charts. The data that is in use in this demo app is a mock DB I created, just to demonstrate the business data I would probably use in a none demo application. This application can be applied for any type of business. Please feel free to check out the live version.
